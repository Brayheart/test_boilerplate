# Higherlevel exercises

The application is not done, but our client demands to test (making sure we are doing the work like we were suppose to ðŸ˜£) **bi-weekly**. This means that friday for every other week, we need to deploy to the staging server. Can you take on this task?

**Development requirement:** 
  1. set up `development` and `staging`
  2. `development` must run all the existing test


**Client requirement:**
  1. Create documentation for every release.

Priority development requirement over client requirement. 

For client req, I we just output the test results from `development` environment to a file. Or if you have the time serve as a static webpage through a different port (just make sure its accessible on `staging`)
